The unity version used here is 2021.3.22f1
The new input system must be installed before the project can be loaded: you can find it in the package manager and directly install the "New Input System" in the search bar
There is already a built version of the game in the assets folder but has some minor bugs, the health not displaying properly. This was not an issue in the original project file.
There is a GitHub link to my game project files, it recommended directly downloading the assets folder.
There is also a link to the new unity input systems for a more detailed explanation:
