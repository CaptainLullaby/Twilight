The unity version used here is 2021.3.22f1
The new input system must be isntalled before the project can be loaded: you can find it in the pakcage manager and directly isntall the "New Inout System" in the search bar
There is already a built version of the game in the assets folder but has some minor bugs, the health not displaying properly. This was not an issue in the original project file.
There is a github link to my game prject files, it reccomended to directly download the assests folder or the build so as to not interrupt you systems setting.
There is also a link to the new unity inout systems for a more detailed explanation:
